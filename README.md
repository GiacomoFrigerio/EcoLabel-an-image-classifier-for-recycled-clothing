# Inage Classifier for Recycled Clothing (FashionMNIST based)

This repository contains code and report for a project which aimed to evaluate different Image Classifiers (KNN, CNN, MLP, MultiLogreg) for Images. A dataset of 70.000 grayscale images, with size 28x28, consisting in 10 different classes of clothing itmes, were used to analyze them. The main libraries used were PVML and KERAS. Addiotionally, an analysis of the best model was provided, visualizing weights, confusion matrices and the worst predictions (the incorrect predictions made with higher confidence by the model).
